# leetcode-js

I've been using this project to organize my DSA study and leetcode solutions all in one place.

I open this project alongside a learning/practice resource and work out ideas in it before submitting solutions.

The `problems` directory contains files named with numbers that correspond to [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problems.

- I usually use `./main.js` to play with solution functions in `problems` dir... if any code is there it's probably from the last time I was doing that.
- I try to add `vitest` unit tests for each problem to verify solutions, sometimes I generate the tests with LLMs... so they aren't all optimum tests
- I do my best to find multiple solutions, keeping track of better performing solutions that I see submitting by much smarter people on leetcode.com
- The `./perf_test.js` exposes a `perfTest` method that can be handy to compare solutions.

The `algos` and `exercises` directories contain assorted items from learning platforms like [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io).
